Dialysis Hypotension Risk Prediction Model 

I trained an XGBoost Classifier to predict whether a patient is hypertensive (yes/no) based on various dialysis-related medical parameters.

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an open-source machine learning algorithm known for its speed, accuracy, and ability to handle large datasets with mixed data types (categorical, numerical, etc.).

It applies gradient boosting, a technique that combines multiple weak learners (e.g., decision trees) in sequenceâ€”each model tries to correct the errors of the previous one to build a strong final model.

Since hypertension is a binary (yes/no) condition, a classifier was used. Had the goal been to predict the exact blood pressure value, a regressor would have been more appropriate.



Steps of Model Training - 

Problem Definition  - Clearly define the goal: Predict whether a dialysis patient is hypertensive (binary classification: Yes/No).

Data Collection

Collect patient records including demographics, dialysis session details, medical history, and treatment parameters.

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values, incorrect data types, or outliers.

Remove irrelevant or duplicate entries if necessary.

Feature Selection & Engineering

Identify relevant input features such as Age, Gender, Weight (Pre/Post), Blood Pressure, Volume Changes, Bath Type, etc.

Encode categorical features like Gender, Bath Type, Dialyzer using label encoding or one-hot encoding.

Data Splitting

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing) to evaluate model performance reliably.

Model Selection

Choose a suitable algorithm. In this case: XGBoost Classifier (for binary classification, efficient and accurate).

Model Training

Train the model using the training data so it can learn the patterns between input features and the hypertension label.

Model Evaluation

Test the model on the unseen testing set.

Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or confusion matrix.

Model Tuning (optional)

Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., with GridSearchCV) to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Model Saving

Save the trained model using a serialization method (like pickle) for deployment and reuse in the Flask application.
